# ♻️ Waste Material Classification Using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
- This project focuses on **classifying waste materials** into multiple categories using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.
- Proper waste segregation plays a crucial role in enhancing recycling systems, reducing environmental pollution, and promoting sustainability.
- By leveraging deep learning, we aim to automate and improve the efficiency of the waste management process.

## 🎯 Objectives
- ✅ Implement a deep learning-based waste classification model.
- ✅ Accurately categorize waste materials into distinct types such as:
  - Cardboard
  - Glass
  - Metal
  - Paper
  - Plastic
  - Food waste
  - Others
- ✅ Facilitate improved waste segregation to:
  - Enhance recycling processes
  - Minimize landfill usage
  - Promote sustainable urban living

## 🛠️ Solution Approach

### 1. Dataset Handling
- 📥 Loaded and organized images of various waste materials into seven predefined categories.
- 🧹 Preprocessed the dataset:
  - Resized all images to a uniform shape
  - Encoded category labels into numeric format

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🔍 Performed EDA to understand:
  - Class distributions
  - Sample visualizations
  - Dataset imbalances (if any)

### 3. Model Development
- 🧠 Designed and implemented a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using a deep learning framework (TensorFlow, Keras).
- 🏋️ Split the data into training and test sets.
- 📊 Trained the CNN model and evaluated it using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Loss and Accuracy plots

## 📈 Results & Evaluation
- The model demonstrated good performance in classifying waste materials.
